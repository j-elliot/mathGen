# mathGen
A simple random math problem generator to construct problems and solutions for my nephew

I now have c++ code to spit random problems and then the answers, and I have a basic java script to build a latex worksheet, populate it with simple addition problems, and then compile it. 

Next steps will be in java adding options for all arithmatic and creating two separate worksheets, one with the problems and one with the problems and solutions. An easy way to do that, I think, would be to run both in parallel, creating both files at the same time. 

Also good would be a script to compile the tools into the correct location and run or not depending on an argument.
